# **ReactJS Personal Landing Page**

This is a full-stack ReactJS Personal Landing Page that showcases my skills as a web developer. The website is built using ReactJS best practices, with a focus on file and folder structure, SCSS, animations using Framer Motion. 

## File and Folder Structure
The file and folder structure of the project follows the recommended ReactJS structure. The root folder contains the main index.js file that renders the React component and the App.js file that serves as the main entry point to the application. The src folder contains all the source code files, organized into the following subfolders:

+ components: Contains all the reusable React components used throughout the application.
+ pages: Contains the React components that represent the different pages of the website, such as the home page, projects page, about page, etc.
+ styles: Contains the SCSS files that define the styles for the application.
+ assets: Contains any static assets used by the application, such as images, videos, etc.
+ data: Contains the schema and configuration files for the Sanity content management system.

##SCSS
SCSS is used to define the styles for the application. The styles folder contains the SCSS files organized into different folders that correspond to the different pages and components of the website. The styles are defined using variables, mixins, and nested rules to improve readability and maintainability.

## Animations using Framer Motion
Framer Motion is used as the primary animation library for the website. Framer Motion provides a simple and intuitive way to add animations and transitions to React components. The AnimatePresence component is used to add exit animations to the components when they are removed from the DOM.


## Conclusion
This ReactJS Personal Landing Page is built using best practices and modern web development technologies. The file and folder structure is organized for scalability and maintainability, the styles are defined using SCSS for improved readability and maintainability, animations are added using Framer Motion. This Personal Landing Page demonstrates my skills and experience as a web developer and serves as an example of modern ReactJS web development practices.
